Android application for the Ogame web browser game.

To do list
==========

- Finish writing the parsers necessary to parse the the fleet event from the overview.

- Have to test the parsing code.

- Add code to return null, negative numbers, 0, errors, or whatever when retrieving a
web page fails (possibly due to the 0300 server time kick?).

- After building the simple and basic Ogame agent, actually build the app to present
user with the overview page.
