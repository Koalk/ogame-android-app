The time of arrival for events is printed in the HTML file. Fortunately,
Javascript is not needed to receive the arrival times (only needed by browser
to make the dynamic countdown timer).
See line 562 of the Overview page source for an example of how the arrival time is listed.

The event details are encoded in HTML as attribute name-value pairs in
the <tr...> tags. See line 571 of the Overview page sourcefor an example.
All fleet events are have a class attribute set as "eventFleet." It is unknown
if this is also the case for missile launches.

After pull parsing reaches to the <tr class="eventFleet"> line, we can parse
for the following items in the following order:
	1. a <td...> element with attribute class="originFleet". This line tells us the
	   origin planet's name.
	2. a <td...> element with attribute class="coordsOrigin". This line tells us the
	   origin planet's coordinates.
	3. a <td...> element with attribute class="icon_movement".
		1. Then pull in a
		   <scan... with class="tooltip tooltipRight tooltipClose". The title
		   attribute of this scan tag contains all the details about the fleet in
		   this event.
	4. a <td...> element with attribute class="destFleet". This line tells us the
	   destination planet's name.
	5. a <td...> element with attribute class="destCoords". This line tells us the
	   destination planet's coordinates.
	   
We repeat the above steps for each <tr class="eventFleet"> we find, and we can
build a list of events to return.
